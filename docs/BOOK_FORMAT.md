# Book format

How a KassenSturz household book is stored, so other programs can read it (D-046). This is documentation, not a promise: the layout can change in any version, and writing into a book from outside KassenSturz isn't supported, because it would bypass KassenSturz's checks. The stable way to move data is the complete export (D-029). Every change to the layout updates this document.

**Status: development layout 3.** Layout 1 was the M0 walking skeleton (D-068); layout 2 added the book's settings (M1.1) and layout 3 the price table (M1.2). Books with an earlier layout are turned away. Until 0.1 the layout may change freely; before 0.1 all development changes are merged into one starting layout, and books from development builds aren't opened by 0.1 (D-045). M1 adds the application ID (D-037), backups (D-033), the lock file (D-038), the change history (D-032, D-066) and much more.

## The file

- One SQLite database per book (D-033), with the extension `.ksz` (D-037).
- `PRAGMA user_version` holds the layout version: currently `3`. A file with `0` isn't treated as a book.
- The journal mode is the classic rollback journal (`DELETE`), never WAL, so no lasting side files sit next to the book (D-033).
- Foreign keys are enforced (`PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` on every connection).

## Conventions

- Every table is `STRICT`: SQLite refuses a value of the wrong type instead of converting it.
- **IDs** are UUIDs, version 7 (D-067), stored as their 16 bytes in a `BLOB`.
- **Amounts** are `INTEGER`s in the currency's minor units, e.g. `5320` for €53.20, never `REAL` (AGENTS.md §3.1 rule 1). Positive amounts flow into an account, negative ones out of it.
- **Dates** are ISO 8601 calendar dates as `TEXT`, e.g. `2026-10-05`, without time or time zone (D-061).
- **Currencies** are ISO 4217 codes as `TEXT`, e.g. `EUR`.
- **Exchange rates** are fixed-point decimals in two `INTEGER` columns: their digits and their number of decimal places, e.g. `10856` and `4` for 1.0856 (D-051). The decimal places are kept as entered, so 1.0850 is `10850` and `4`. Never `REAL`.

## Tables

### `settings`

The book's settings: exactly one row. They are stored in the book, not in the app, so every computer calculates the same way.

| Column | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | INTEGER, primary key | Always `1` |
| `rounding_mode` | TEXT | How calculations round a result that falls between two minor units, e.g. a third of €1.00 (D-027). One of `half_away_from_zero` (the default: 2.5 → 3, −2.5 → −3), `half_even` (2.5 → 2, 3.5 → 4), `half_toward_zero` (2.5 → 2), `toward_zero` (2.9 → 2), `away_from_zero` (2.1 → 3), `floor` (−2.1 → −3) or `ceiling` (2.1 → 3). Changing it never changes stored amounts, only later calculations |

### `currencies`

The currencies the book uses. A currency's decimal places are taken from KassenSturz's ISO 4217 table when the book first uses it (D-062) and stay fixed from then on, so an update to that table can never rescale stored amounts (D-027).

| Column | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `code` | TEXT, primary key | ISO 4217 code: three capital letters |
| `minor_digits` | INTEGER, 0–18 | Decimal places: 2 for EUR, 0 for JPY |

### `accounts`

Accounts and categories (`docs/GLOSSARY.md`).

| Column | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | BLOB (16 bytes), primary key | UUIDv7 |
| `name` | TEXT | The name the user gave it |
| `kind` | TEXT | `asset` or `liability` (shown as accounts), `income` or `expense` (shown as categories), `equity` (internal, for starting balances) |
| `currency` | TEXT → `currencies.code` | The currency of its amounts |

### `transactions`

| Column | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | BLOB (16 bytes), primary key | UUIDv7 |
| `booking_date` | TEXT | ISO 8601 date the bank booked it, or the user entered (D-030) |
| `payee` | TEXT, may be NULL | Who the money came from or went to, as the user wants it shown |
| `currency` | TEXT → `currencies.code` | The currency all its parts are in |

### `splits`

The parts of each transaction (shown to users as "Parts", D-017). A transaction's parts add up to exactly zero; KassenSturz checks this when it writes a transaction and again when it reads one.

| Column | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | BLOB (16 bytes), primary key | UUIDv7 |
| `transaction_id` | BLOB → `transactions.id` | The transaction; deleting it deletes its parts |
| `position` | INTEGER, from 0 | The order the parts were entered in; unique per transaction |
| `account_id` | BLOB → `accounts.id` | The account or category the amount is booked to |
| `amount` | INTEGER | Minor units in the transaction's currency, which in layout 1 is also the account's currency |

Index: `splits_by_account` on `splits (account_id)`, for an account's register and balance.

### `prices`

The book's price table: exchange rates, each for one day (D-028). In v1 they are entered by hand. Security prices will join this table when securities come, after 1.0 (D-029).

| Column | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | BLOB (16 bytes), primary key | UUIDv7 |
| `date` | TEXT | ISO 8601 date the rate applies to |
| `from_currency` | TEXT → `currencies.code` | The currency one unit of which is priced |
| `to_currency` | TEXT → `currencies.code` | The currency the price is in; never the same as `from_currency` |
| `rate_digits` | INTEGER, 1 to 999999999999999999 | The rate's digits: `10856` for 1.0856. Rates are always above zero |
| `rate_decimal_places` | INTEGER, 0–18 | The rate's decimal places: `4` for 1.0856 |
| `source` | TEXT | Where the rate came from: `manual` (entered by hand) is the only source so far |

One unit of `from_currency` costs `rate_digits` × 10^−`rate_decimal_places` units of `to_currency`. There is at most one rate per `from_currency`, `to_currency` and `date` (a unique index); the other direction is a separate rate, and converting that way divides by the rate instead.

## Reading a book

An account's balance is the sum of `splits.amount` for its `account_id`. Its register joins `splits` with `transactions` and orders by `booking_date`, then `id`. Add amounts in 64-bit integers or wider, never as floating point. The rate from one currency into another on a day is the row with the latest `date` on or before that day.
